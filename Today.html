<!--
The Web protocol, HTTP, was designed to be stateless to keep 
transactions between a browser and server brief and cut 
down on the overhead of keeping connections open. 
Stateless means that after a transaction takes place between the 
browser and server, the connection is lost and neither the browser 
nor server have any recollection of what transpired between one 
session and the next. But as the Internet grew and people started 
filling up shopping carts with all kinds of goodies, ordering everything 
from groceries to music, books, prescription drugs, and even
cars and homes, it became necessary for merchants to remember 
what their customers purchased, their preferences, registration numbers, 
IDs, and so on.
A cookie is a local file used to store information, and it is persistent; 
that is, it is maintained between browser sessions
and remains even when the user shuts down his computer. 
The cookie idea became very popular and is now supported 
by all major browsers.
Cookies can make a Web page personal and friendly, and store 
important information about the user's language, reading, or music 
preferences, how many times he has visited your site, track items in a 
shopping cart, and more. But they can also be annoying, and 
some question the security of putting unknown data on
their hard drive.
The built-in escape() function is used to 
URI(Uniform Resource Identifier)
encode the string that 
was entered as input by the user.
The built-in unescape() function is used to convert the URI 
encoded string back into its original ASCII format.

//When you access document.cookie, the browser returns

<!--
Why it doesn't work when you just double-click the file (file:///):
Modern browsers (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge) 
restrict cookie usage for local files opened with the file:/// 
protocol due to security reasons.
Cookies only work properly over:
1. http:// or https://
2. Local web servers (like localhost)
Solution:
A. Use Live Server in VS Code
1. Install the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code.
2. Right-click your HTML file.
3. Click “Open with Live Server.”
4. It will open in a browser like:
http://127.0.0.1:5500/yourfile.html
5. Try your code.

B. If you have Python installed
1. Open the folder where your HTML file is located.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt in that folder.
3. Run:
python -m http.server
4. In your browser, go to:
http://localhost:8000
5. Click Set Cookie, then Get Cookie
